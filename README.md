## Exercises

### 1. If Statements
This set of exercises covers how to use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements in JavaScript to control the flow of your program based on conditions.

- **Exercise 1:** Check the temperature and output appropriate messages (too hot, moderate, cold).
- **Exercise 2:** Determine school admission eligibility based on scores.
- **Exercise 3:** Check water availability for a village.
- **Exercise 4:** Check the quality of a product using nested `if` statements.

For full exercise solutions, check the [If Statements File](./path/to/if_statements.js).

### 2. For and While Loops
This set of exercises helps you understand how to use `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops in JavaScript to handle repetitive tasks.

- **Exercise 1:** Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.
- **Exercise 2:** Create a multiplication table for the number 5.
- **Exercise 3:** Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a `while` loop.
- **Exercise 4:** Input validation using a `do-while` loop.
- **Exercise 5:** Stop a loop when a condition is met using `break`.
- **Exercise 6:** Skip even numbers in a loop using `continue`.
- **Exercise 7:** Print a right-angled triangle using nested loops.

For full exercise solutions, check the [For and While Loops File](./path/to/loops.js).

### 3. HTML Tags List
This section provides a list of common HTML tags and their uses. These tags are fundamental to web development and are frequently used to structure web content.

- **Exercise:** Practice using basic HTML tags to create a simple webpage with links, images, headings, and paragraphs.

Check the [HTML Tags Example](./path/to/html_tags.html) for sample HTML structure.
